TODO list:
tune logging (specify correct log levels, make sure its configurable in a file or code). At this point extra logs appear and pollute logs
use listener in BaseTest class only (at this point I also specify it in testng.xml, otherwise test does not work)
store locators in txt file and parse it
sync with JDBC
