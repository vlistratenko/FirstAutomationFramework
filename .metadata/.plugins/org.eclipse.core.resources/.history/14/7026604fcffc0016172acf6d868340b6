TODO list:
tune logging (specify correct log levels, make sure its configurable in a file or code). At this point extra logs appear and pollute logs
use listener in BaseTest class only (at this point I also specify it in testng.xml, otherwise test does not work)
store locators in txt file and parse it
sync with JDBC
connect to git
Allure test report
think about implementation of WebDriverEventListener >> implement loggin on some actions at listener level
